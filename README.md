This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: missing dependencies in the dependency array. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where the `useEffect` hook is not correctly specifying its dependencies, leading to unexpected re-renders and potential performance issues or incorrect results. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, with the correct dependency array specified to fix the issue.
